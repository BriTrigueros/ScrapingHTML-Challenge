# ScrapingHTML-Challenge

# Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project

Welcome to this web scraping and data analysis project! In this project, you will strengthen your skills in collecting, organizing, and analyzing data from the web. You'll be working on two technical tasks:

## Task 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

In this task, you will scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook named `part_1_mars_news.ipynb`. You'll use automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup to achieve this. Here's a brief overview of what you'll do:

- Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news website.
- Identify HTML elements to scrape.
- Extract titles and preview text of news articles.
- Store the scraping results in Python data structures.
- Optionally, export the scraped data to a JSON file.

## Task 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

For the second task, you will scrape and analyze Mars weather data. Open the Jupyter Notebook named `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb` and follow the instructions provided. Here's what you'll be doing:

- Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site.
- Scrape data from the HTML table using Beautiful Soup.
- Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Examine and manipulate the DataFrame to answer specific questions about Mars weather.
- Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
